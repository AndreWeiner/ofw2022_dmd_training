Unsteady flow over a surface mounted cube

The set-up is based on the description given by Martinuzzi and Tropea:

    R. Martinuzzi and C. Tropea. The Flow Around Surface-Mounted, Prismatic
    Obstacles Placed in a Fully Developed Channel Flow. Journal of Fluids
    Engineering, 115(1):85-92, 1993.

where the Reynolds number based on the cube height is Re_h 40000.

Turbulence is modelled using the Spalart-Allmaras Improved Delayed Detached
Eddy Simulation (IDDES) model
